# termiNAS Project - Custom Instructions

## Project Overview

termiNAS is a secure, versioned backup server for Debian Linux that provides ransomware protection through real-time incremental snapshots. The system allows remote clients (Windows/Linux) to upload files via SFTP, with server-side automatic versioning that prevents client-side malware from corrupting or deleting backup history.

**Key Principle**: Server-side immutability - clients can upload files, but cannot modify or delete version history stored in root-owned snapshots.

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Ransomware Protection**: Ensure backup versions remain intact even if client machines are compromised
2. **Real-time Versioning**: Automatically snapshot file changes as they occur using inotify monitoring
3. **Secure Access Control**: Strict chroot SFTP-only access with fail2ban protection
4. **Efficient Storage**: Use hardlinks for incremental backups to minimize disk usage
5. **Easy Setup**: Automated configuration scripts for both server and clients

### Security Requirements
- Users chrooted to home directories (cannot access other parts of filesystem)
- Version snapshots owned by root (users can read but not modify)
- fail2ban protection against brute force attacks and DOS
- SSH/SFTP only (no shell access for backup users)
- 64-character secure passwords by default

### User Experience Goals
- One-command server setup (`setup.sh`)
- One-command user creation (`create_user.sh <username>`)
- Interactive client setup wizards (Linux: `setup-client.sh`, Windows: `setup-client.ps1`)
- Comprehensive management tools (`manage_users.sh` with 9 commands)
- Clear documentation with troubleshooting guides

## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Security Architecture
1. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Network layer: fail2ban blocks malicious IPs at iptables level
   - Authentication layer: SSH with strong passwords or keys
   - Authorization layer: Chroot prevents filesystem access outside home
   - Data layer: Root-owned snapshots prevent client modification

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Backup users: SFTP-only, chrooted, nologin shell
   - Monitor service: Runs as root but only writes to versions directories
   - Client credentials: Stored with restrictive permissions (600 Linux, Administrators-only Windows)

### Snapshot Strategy
- **Trigger**: inotify events (`close_write`, `moved_to`) - captures complete files only
- **Method**: Btrfs snapshot (not rsync) for instant, space-efficient copies
- **Timing**: Debounce period (default 10s) to coalesce rapid changes
- **Storage**: CoW snapshots share data blocks with source until modified
- **Ownership**: root:backupusers with 755 (readable by user, immutable)

### Btrfs Quota Architecture
Per-user storage quotas use **Simple Quotas (squotas)** for reliable, high-performance enforcement.

**Why Simple Quotas?**
- Full btrfs qgroup accounting causes severe write performance issues (kernel hangs)
- Even level-0 qgroups with limits can block writes during back-reference resolution
- Simple quotas (`btrfs quota enable --simple`) avoid this by attributing all extents to the subvolume that first allocated them
- All accounting decisions are local to the allocation/freeing operation
- Reference: https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Qgroups.html#simple-quotas-squota

**Level-0 Qgroup (0/SUBVOL_ID)**: Direct quota on uploads subvolume
- Created automatically when subvolume is created
- Quota limit is set directly on uploads subvolume
- Stored in `/home/<username>/.terminas-qgroup`

**Hybrid Quota Check**: Total usage monitoring after each snapshot
- After each snapshot, calculates: uploads_size + all_snapshots_size
- If total > user quota limit, uploads are blocked (subvolume limit set to 1 byte)
- User can still delete files from uploads
- Quota is re-checked when:
  1. User deletes a file from uploads (immediate, via inotify delete event)
  2. During daily retention cleanup (catches any missed cases)
- Flag file: `/home/<username>/.terminas-quota-exceeded`

**Configuration Files**:
- `.terminas-qgroup`: Uploads subvolume qgroup ID (e.g., "0/1234")
- `.terminas-quota-limit`: Configured quota limit in GB
- `.terminas-quota-exceeded`: Flag file when over total quota

**Important**: Server setup uses `btrfs quota enable --simple /home` to enable squotas mode.

### Retention Policy
**Grandfather-Father-Son (default)**:
- Daily: Keep last 7 days
- Weekly: Keep last 4 weeks (one snapshot per week)
- Monthly: Keep last 6 months (one snapshot per month)

**Simple Age-Based (alternative)**:
- Keep snapshots for N days, delete older

**Per-User Overrides**: Configurable in `/etc/terminas-retention.conf`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
**Bash Scripts**:
- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang
- Enable strict mode: `set -euo pipefail` (except where specific handling needed)
- Use functions for modularity
- Quote all variable expansions: `"$variable"`
- Use `[[` for conditionals instead of `[`
- Validate inputs and check command exit codes
- Add descriptive comments for complex logic

**PowerShell Scripts**:
- Use `[CmdletBinding()]` for advanced function features
- Set `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"` for critical operations
- Use proper parameter validation (`[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]`)
- Use `Try-Catch` for error handling
- Comment-based help (`.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.EXAMPLE`)
- Use approved verbs for function names

### Testing Approach
- **Always test in VM/test environment first** before production
- Test idempotency: Run setup scripts multiple times safely
- Test edge cases: Empty directories, special characters in filenames
- Test security: Attempt to bypass chroot, modify versions as user
- Test fail2ban: Verify IP banning and unbanning
- Test cross-platform: Linux and Windows clients

### Error Handling
- Scripts should fail gracefully with clear error messages
- Use colored output: Red for errors, Yellow for warnings, Green for success
- Log important operations for troubleshooting
- Validate prerequisites before making system changes
- Provide rollback instructions in documentation

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintain compatibility with:
  - Debian Linux (recent stable releases)
  - Windows Server 2008 R2+ (PowerShell 2.0+)
  - Bash 4.x+ (avoid Bash 5-specific features)
- Avoid breaking changes to:
  - Directory structure (`/home/<user>/uploads`, `/home/<user>/versions`)
  - Credential file formats
  - Configuration file formats

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Server Feature
1. Update `setup.sh` with idempotent checks (grep existing config before adding)
2. Update `create_user.sh` if per-user setup needed
3. Test on clean Debian VM
4. Update README.md with new feature documentation
5. Add troubleshooting section if complex

### Adding a New Client Feature
1. Update both `upload.sh` (Linux) and `upload.ps1` (Windows) for parity
2. Update `setup-client.sh` and `setup-client.ps1` if automation needed
3. Test on multiple client OS versions
4. Update README.md with examples
5. Update manual scheduling section if applicable

### Adding a New Management Command
1. Add function to `manage_users.sh`
2. Update usage function with new command
3. Add to main case statement
4. Test with various users and edge cases
5. Document in README.md "User Management" section

### Fixing a Security Issue
1. Assess severity and impact
2. Create fix with minimal disruption
3. Test thoroughly in isolated environment
4. Update documentation with security note
5. Consider if users need to re-run setup scripts

## Known Limitations and Workarounds

### Chroot SFTP Restrictions
- **Issue**: All files in home directory must be root-owned
- **Workaround**: Only `uploads/` and `versions/` subdirectories are writable/readable by user
- **Note**: Cannot use `.bash*` files in user home (breaks chroot)

### inotify Event Timing
- **Issue**: Using `create` event captures incomplete files during upload
- **Solution**: Use only `close_write` and `moved_to` events (captures complete files)
- **Trade-off**: Very fast uploads may complete before close_write triggers
- **Note**: Current inotify monitor bug: snapshots cannot be deleted until the service is restarted (see docs/ARCHITECTURE_PER_USER_INOTIFY.md)

### fail2ban and Testing
- **Issue**: Testing authentication from same IP can trigger bans
- **Workaround**: Use `fail2ban-client unban --all` to clear bans
- **Production**: Consider whitelisting admin IPs in jail configuration

### Windows PowerShell 2.0 Compatibility
- **Issue**: Older cmdlets and syntax required for Windows Server 2008 R2
- **Solution**: Avoid PowerShell 3.0+ specific features
- **Testing**: Test on oldest supported Windows version

⚠️ **Backup existing system configuration before running setup scripts**
⚠️ **fail2ban will ban IPs after failed login attempts - whitelist admin IPs**
⚠️ **Chroot SFTP requires strict directory ownership - follow documented structure**
⚠️ **Credentials are stored on disk - ensure proper file permissions**
⚠️ **Monitor disk usage - snapshots can grow large without retention cleanup**
