# test_delete_user_cleanup.sh - Verify Btrfs subvolume deletion after user removal
# Creates a test user, triggers a snapshot, deletes the user, and verifies that
# subvolumes are properly marked for deletion.
#
# IMPORTANT: Pending Btrfs Deletions Are Normal
# =============================================
# When a user is deleted, Btrfs subvolumes are marked for deletion but space
# reclamation happens asynchronously by the Btrfs cleaner. Pending deletions
# (shown by `btrfs subvolume list -d`) are NORMAL and expected.
#
# Root Cause of Delayed Cleanup:
# The terminas-monitor.sh service uses `inotifywait -m -r /home` which creates
# inotify watches on all directories under /home. These watches hold kernel-level
# references to inodes. When a user's directories are deleted, the inotify watches
# remain until the inotifywait process is restarted, preventing the Btrfs cleaner
# from immediately reclaiming space.
#
# This is NOT a bug - it's expected behavior:
# - Pending deletions consume space until cleanup completes
# - Space will be reclaimed when terminas-monitor.service restarts (e.g., reboot)
# - No data integrity issues result from pending deletions
#
# This test verifies:
# 1. User deletion completes successfully
# 2. Home directory is removed
# 3. No userspace processes hold open file handles to deleted directories
# 4. Subvolumes are properly marked for deletion (pending deletions are acceptable)
#
# Usage:
#   sudo ./test_delete_user_cleanup.sh
#
# Exit codes: 0 on success, non-zero on failure
