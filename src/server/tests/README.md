# termiNAS Test Scripts

This directory contains test scripts for validating termiNAS functionality.

## Available Tests

### `test_create_user.sh` - User Creation and Password Change Tests

Comprehensive test suite for user creation and password change functionality including:
- User creation with auto-generated password
- SFTP authentication with initial password
- Samba authentication with initial password (if Samba enabled)
- Password change via `manage_users.sh change-password`
- SFTP authentication with new password
- Samba authentication with new password (if Samba enabled)
- Verification that old password is rejected

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run all user creation and password change tests
sudo ./test_create_user.sh

# Cleanup test user and files
sudo ./test_create_user.sh --cleanup-only
```

**Test Configuration:**
- Test user: `terminas_test_create_user`
- Initial password: Auto-generated 64-character secure password
- New password: 43-character password meeting all requirements
- Tests both SFTP and Samba (if available)

**What it tests:**
1. User creation with auto-generated password
2. Password extraction from create_user.sh output
3. SFTP authentication with initial password
4. Samba authentication with initial password (if Samba installed)
5. Password change command execution
6. SFTP authentication with new password
7. Samba authentication with new password (if Samba installed)
8. Old password rejection for both SFTP and Samba

**Dependencies:**
- **Required**: openssh-server (SFTP)
- **Optional**: sshpass or lftp (for automated SFTP tests)
- **Optional**: samba, smbclient (for Samba tests)
- **Optional**: expect (for automated password prompts)

**Expected Output:**
- ✓ PASS: Test succeeded
- ✗ FAIL: Test failed (check logs)
- ℹ INFO: Informational message

**Notes:**
- Test will skip SFTP tests if neither sshpass nor lftp is available
- Test will skip Samba tests if Samba is not installed or running
- Test automatically cleans up after completion
- If expect is not available, password change may require manual intervention

### `test_delete_user_cleanup.sh` - User Deletion and Btrfs Cleanup Tests

Test suite that verifies proper Btrfs subvolume deletion after user removal.
This test validates that user deletion completes successfully and subvolumes are properly 
marked for deletion.

**Important Note:**
Pending Btrfs deletions (shown by `btrfs subvolume list -d`) after user deletion are 
**normal and expected behavior**. This is caused by inotify watches held by the 
terminas-monitor.sh service. See the "Understanding Pending Deletions" section below for details.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run deletion cleanup test
sudo ./test_delete_user_cleanup.sh
```

**Test Configuration:**
- Test user: `terminas_test_cleanup` (with unique PID suffix)
- Creates 20MB test file
- Waits 80s for snapshot creation
- Checks pending deletions before/after user deletion

**What it tests:**
1. Baseline pending deletions count
2. User creation with quota
3. File upload and snapshot creation
4. Detection of home directory as subvolume vs regular directory
5. User deletion process
6. Verification that home directory is removed
7. Pending deletions after user deletion
8. Btrfs cleaner operation after sync
9. Verify no userspace processes hold file handles

**Understanding Pending Deletions:**

When a user is deleted, Btrfs marks subvolumes for deletion but space reclamation happens 
asynchronously. The `btrfs subvolume list -d` command may show "DELETED" entries - this is 
**NORMAL and expected behavior**, not a bug.

**Why Pending Deletions Occur:**

The `terminas-monitor.sh` service uses `inotifywait -m -r /home` which creates inotify 
watches on all directories under `/home`. These watches hold **kernel-level references** 
to inodes. When a user's directories are deleted, the inotify watches remain active until 
the inotifywait process is restarted, preventing immediate space reclamation.

**Key Points:**
- Pending deletions continue to consume space until cleanup completes
- Space is reclaimed when `terminas-monitor.service` restarts (e.g., reboot)
- No data integrity issues result from pending deletions
- This is standard Linux/Btrfs behavior, not a termiNAS bug

**What This Test Verifies:**
1. User deletion completes successfully
2. Home directory is removed from filesystem
3. No userspace processes hold open file handles to deleted directories
4. Subvolumes are properly marked for deletion

**Expected Output:**
- Diagnostic info about home directory (subvolume vs regular directory)
- List of subvolumes for the test user
- Pending deletions count at each step
- ✓ PASS: Subvolumes properly marked for deletion
- Note: Pending deletions are explained as normal inotify behavior

**Alternative Architecture:**

For immediate space reclamation, a per-user inotify architecture could be implemented 
where each user has their own inotifywait process. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PER_USER_INOTIFY.md` 
for details. This is not currently implemented as pending deletions are harmless.

**Notes:**
- Test automatically cleans up test user
- Requires Btrfs on `/home`
- Must run as root

### `test_quota.sh` - Quota Functionality Tests

Comprehensive test suite for Btrfs quota functionality including:
- Quota configuration verification
- User creation with quota limits
- File uploads within quota
- Quota enforcement (blocking when exceeded)
- Quota modification (increase/decrease)
- Quota removal (unlimited)
- Integration with management commands

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run all quota tests
sudo ./test_quota.sh

# Cleanup test user and files
sudo ./test_quota.sh --cleanup-only
```

**Test Configuration:**
- Test user: `terminas_test_quota`
- Quota limit: 1GB (expandable during tests)
- Test file size: 300MB each
- Monitor wait time: 70s (for snapshot creation)

**What it tests:**
1. Btrfs quotas are enabled on `/home`
2. User creation with `--quota` parameter
3. Quota configuration via qgroups
4. File uploads and automatic snapshots
5. Quota enforcement blocks snapshots when exceeded
6. Quota warnings at 90% threshold
7. Quota modification commands work correctly
8. Quota removal sets to unlimited
9. Quota info displayed in `manage_users.sh` commands
10. Log entries for quota events

**Expected Output:**
- ✓ PASS: Test succeeded
- ✗ FAIL: Test failed (check logs)
- ℹ INFO: Informational message

**Notes:**
- Test user remains after completion for inspection
- Check `/var/log/terminas.log` for detailed logs
- Run cleanup before re-running tests

## Adding New Tests

When adding new test scripts:

1. **Name:** `test_<feature>.sh` (e.g., `test_samba.sh`, `test_retention.sh`)
2. **Make executable:** `chmod +x test_<feature>.sh`
3. **Use colors:** RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE for output
4. **Include cleanup:** `--cleanup-only` option
5. **Document here:** Add entry to this README

### Test Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_<feature>.sh - Test script for <feature> functionality
set -e

# Color codes
RED='\033[0;31m'
GREEN='\033[0;32m'
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
BLUE='\033[0;34m'
NC='\033[0m'

# Get directories
TEST_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$TEST_DIR/.." && pwd)"

# Test configuration
TEST_USER="terminas_test_<feature>"

# Check root
if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]; then
    echo -e "${RED}ERROR: Must run as root${NC}"
    exit 1
fi

# Cleanup function
cleanup() {
    if id "$TEST_USER" &>/dev/null; then
        "$SCRIPT_DIR/delete_user.sh" "$TEST_USER" || true
    fi
}

# Handle --cleanup-only
if [ "${1:-}" = "--cleanup-only" ]; then
    cleanup
    exit 0
fi

# Run tests
print_header() {
    echo ""
    echo -e "${BLUE}========================================${NC}"
    echo -e "${BLUE}$1${NC}"
    echo -e "${BLUE}========================================${NC}"
    echo ""
}

print_result() {
    local result="$1"
    local message="$2"
    
    if [ "$result" = "PASS" ]; then
        echo -e "${GREEN}✓ PASS:${NC} $message"
    elif [ "$result" = "FAIL" ]; then
        echo -e "${RED}✗ FAIL:${NC} $message"
    elif [ "$result" = "INFO" ]; then
        echo -e "${YELLOW}ℹ INFO:${NC} $message"
    fi
}

# Test implementation here...
```

## Running All Tests

To run all tests in sequence:

```bash
# Run each test script
for test in test_*.sh; do
    echo "Running $test..."
    sudo ./"$test" || echo "Test failed: $test"
    echo ""
done

# Cleanup all tests
for test in test_*.sh; do
    sudo ./"$test" --cleanup-only
done
```

## CI/CD Integration

These tests can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run termiNAS tests
  run: |
    cd src/server/tests
    sudo ./test_quota.sh
    sudo ./test_quota.sh --cleanup-only
```

## Troubleshooting

**Test fails immediately:**
- Check if running as root: `sudo ./test_quota.sh`
- Verify termiNAS is properly installed: `./setup.sh`
- Check Btrfs is mounted on `/home`: `df -T /home`

**Monitor tests fail:**
- Verify monitor service is running: `systemctl status terminas-monitor.service`
- Check monitor logs: `tail -f /var/log/terminas.log`
- Increase `MONITOR_WAIT_TIME` in test script

**Cleanup fails:**
- Manually delete test user: `./delete_user.sh terminas_test_quota`
- Remove runtime files: `rm -f /var/run/terminas/*test*`

## Contributing
